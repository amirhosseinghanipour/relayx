# RelayX
RelayX is a unified tensor computation library designed to abstract backend-specific implementations to execute numerical operations across multiple ML frameworks. RelayX provides a unified interface for tensor operations, currently supporting JAX and PyTorch backends, with a modular design that facilitates integration with additional computational frameworks.

## Overview
RelayX addresses the challenge of backend fragmentation in machine learning and scientific computing by offering a single API that abstracts the underlying computation engine. Whether targeting CPU, GPU, or TPU environments, RelayX ensures consistent behavior and output across supported backends, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking portability without sacrificing performance. The library leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation where applicable (e.g., in JAX) and native hardware acceleration (e.g., in PyTorch) to deliver efficient execution tailored to each backend's strengths.

## Key Features
- Unified Tensor Interface: Operates on a custom `RelayTensor` abstraction for data from JAX, PyTorch, or NumPy, with seamless conversion between backends.
- Backend-Agnostic Design: Execute the same code on JAX or PyTorch without modification, with support for adding new backends via a simple registration mechanism.
- Extensible Operation Set: Implements a broad range of tensor computations through a pluggable backend system to extend functionality as needed.
- Performance Optimization: Harnesses backend-specific optimizations, such as JAX’s JIT compilation and PyTorch’s CUDA support, while maintaining a consistent API.
- Lightweight and Modular: Minimal dependencies and a clean architecture ensure easy integration into existing workflows.

## Architecture
RelayX is built around two core components:

1. RelayTensor:
    - A lightweight wrapper around backend-specific tensor objects (e.g., jnp.ndarray, torch.Tensor).
    - Provides backend conversion (to_backend) and shape/data accessors.
    - Ensures compatibility across frameworks without deep copies where possible.
2. RelayX:
    - The main computation engine managing a registry of backend implementations.
    - Exposes a unified API via the compute method to dispatch operations to the appropriate backend.
    - Supports dynamic backend switching and custom backend registration.

## Use Cases
- Cross-Platform Development: Write tensor-based algorithms once and deploy them on JAX for TPU acceleration or PyTorch for GPU support.
- Research and Prototyping: Experiment with different backends without rewriting code to leverage JAX’s functional programming or PyTorch’s imperative style.
- Production Deployment: Abstract hardware-specific details for flexible deployment across diverse environments.

## Performance Considerations
RelayX introduces minimal overhead by delegating computation directly to backend primitives. For JAX, operations are JIT-compiled where beneficial, while PyTorch operations leverage native CUDA/CPU optimizations. Users should note that cross-backend tensor conversion incurs a cost, mitigated by lazy conversion within the `RelayTensor` abstraction.

## Roadmap
- Expand backend support (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy-only).
- Enhance operation coverage for advanced neural network components.
- Add benchmarking suite to compare backend performance.
- Integrate gradient computation for automatic differentiation.
